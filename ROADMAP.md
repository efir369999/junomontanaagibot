# Proof of Time — Roadmap

*The plan reveals itself through time.*

## Vision

### 0526 — AI Security Auditing
AI models are capable of conducting high-quality security audits of code.

The future of software security lies in AI-assisted verification. Machine learning models can analyze codebases at scale, identifying vulnerabilities that human reviewers might miss. This project demonstrates that frontier AI can serve as a credible auditor for cryptographic implementations.

### 2304 — The Pulse as VDF
The heartbeat as a Verifiable Delay Function.

Each heartbeat is:
- **Sequential** — one must complete before the next begins
- **Non-parallelizable** — you cannot compute two heartbeats simultaneously
- **Unforgeable** — you cannot fake the passage of biological time

The body as a timestamp server. Life itself proves the passage of time through irreversible biological computation. Proof of Time captures this essence in silicon: time that cannot be compressed, parallelized, or counterfeited.

| Genesis | COMPLETE | Core protocol, VDF engine, privacy layer |
| v1.0 | COMPLETE | Production-ready node, GMP acceleration |
| v1.1 | COMPLETE | Dashboard, emission tracking |
| v1.2 | COMPLETE | Wallet integration, security audit |
| v2.0 | PLANNED | Mobile wallet, light clients |
| v3.0 | PLANNED | Smart contracts, time-locked execution |

## Philosophy

Bitcoin mining determines market cycles through energy expenditure.

Proof of Time determines truth through temporal expenditure.

Both are scarce. Both are real. Time is the ultimate proof of work — you cannot mine it faster, you can only wait.

*Time is the fire in which we burn.*
*Time is the proof we cannot forge.*
